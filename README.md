# Foundations of Machine Learning Models

## Assignment: Polynomial Regression II

#### Name: Richard Lee

### Details

The purpose of this assignment is expose you to a (second) polynomial regression problem. Your goal is to:

1. Create the following figure using matplotlib, which plots the data from the file called `PolynomialRegressionData_II.csv`.  
2. Perform a PolynomialFeatures transformation, then perform linear regression to calculate the optimal ordinary least squares regression model parameters.
3. Recreate the first figure by adding the best fit curve to all subplots.
4. Infer the true model parameters.
